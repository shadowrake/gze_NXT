# Source code for GZE's website 
Website: https://greenzoneesports.com

## Reason to make the repo public?
Due to the closure of Greenzone esports, the fact I created the whole site and there was no NDA, I have chosen to make the whole site's codebase public (ofcourse any api keys or env variables will not be included), the codebase could be help to someone.

## What is the tech stack?
Next.js, Node v.20/Edge-runtime (contact section doesn't work on the edge-runtime, it could work if you use edge function from services like supabase), mongodb with a prisma layer (mongodb files/folders in lib are unused), mainly Javascript with some Typescript, TailwindCSS for styling.

## The project is dead and will not be updated!
