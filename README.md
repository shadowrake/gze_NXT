# Website GZE

## Reason to make the repo public?
Due to the closure of Greenzone esports, the fact I created the whole site and there was no NDA, I have chosen to make the whole site codebase public (ofcourse any api keys or env variables will not be included), so that mabye someone want to use parts of the codebase.

## What is the tech stack?
Next.js, Node/Edge runtime, mongodb with prisma layer, mainly Javascript with some typescript, tailwind
